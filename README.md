# Not Yet Done
This libraray currently works and has a lot of functionality. However, there are still a few things I would like to change/add. Now that I have more time, I am working on this repo to implement the following points:
- [ ] SPI Driver
  - [ ] Settable Prescalar Clock Frequency.
  - [ ] Initialize as a master or Slave.
  - [ ] MSB first or LSB First?
  - [ ] A general spi driver that allows users to set up most (hopefully all) spi hardware functionality.
  - [ ] Support for ATmega128, ATmega324, and ATmega16. (Hopefully support can be easily added for many more AVR microcontrollers)
- [ ] I2C Driver
  - [ ] A general i2c driver that allows users to set up most (hopefully all) i2c hardware functionality.
  - [ ] Support for ATmega128, ATmega324, and ATmega16. (Hopefully support can be easily added for many more AVR microcontrollers)
- [ ] Adafruit Touchscreen functionality
  - [ ] Implement putchar function so users can use printf.
  - [ ] implement some kind of text field for better text display.
  - [ ] implement panes kinda like in javafx. (?idk yet?).
  - [ ] Implement the bitmap function.
  - [ ] Use the SD card slot
- [ ] Code Style
  - [ ] All files follow my coding and naming convetion. (e.g. variables are all lower case seperated by underscores).
  - [ ] Proper encapsulation. The .h files that are presented to users only contain public members.
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] All files contain an appropriate header.
  - [ ] All functions contain an appropriate header.
  - [ ] All structures contain an appropriate header.
  - [ ] All global and structure data fields contain appropraite line comment.
